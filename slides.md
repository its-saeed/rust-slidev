# What is Undefined Behavior?
Undefined Behavior (UB) is a term used in programming languages to describe a situation where the behavior of a program is unpredictable or not well-defined. This can occur when the program violates the language's rules or specifications, leading to unexpected results or crashes.
It can happen due to various reasons, such as:

<v-clicks>

- Accessing memory that has already been freed
- Dereferencing a null or invalid pointer
- Using uninitialized variables
- Buffer overflows

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## What to do?
üòÄIn a safe programming language, errors are trapped as they happen.

‚òπÔ∏èIn an unsafe programming language, errors are not trapped. Rather, after executing an erroneous operation the program keeps going, but in a silently faulty way that may have observable consequences later on.
</v-click>

# If any step in a program‚Äôs execution has undefined behavior, then the <span color="red">entire execution</span> is without meaning.‚ò†Ô∏è

<br>

<v-click>

## ‚ö†Ô∏èAlso, it‚Äôs not that the execution is meaningful up to the point where undefined behavior happens: the bad effects can actually <span color="orange">precede</span> the undefined operation.

</v-click>

<!-- 
If any step in a program‚Äôs execution has undefined behavior, then the entire execution is without meaning. This is important: it‚Äôs not that evaluating (1<<32) has an unpredictable result, but rather that the entire execution of a program that evaluates this expression is meaningless. Also, it‚Äôs not that the execution is meaningful up to the point where undefined behavior happens: the bad effects can actually precede the undefined operation. 

In summary: There‚Äôs nothing inherently bad about running with a ball in your hands and also there‚Äôs nothing inherently bad about shifting a 32-bit number by 33 bit positions. But one is against the rules of basketball and the other is against the rules of C and C++. In both cases, the people designing the game have created arbitrary rules and we either have to play by them or else find a game we like better.

# Why Is Undefined Behavior Good?

It simplifies the compiler‚Äôs job, making it possible to generate very efficient code in certain situations. For example:

<v-clicks>

* High-performance array code doesn‚Äôt need to perform bounds checks.
* When compiling a loop that increments a signed integer, the C compiler does not need to worry about the case where the variable overflows and becomes negative

</v-clicks>

<br>

<v-click>

# Why Is Undefined Behavior Bad?
When programmers cannot be trusted to reliably avoid undefined behavior, we end up with programs that silently misbehave.

</v-click>

<!-- certain tight loops speed up by 30%-50% when the compiler is permitted to take advantage of the undefined nature of signed overflow. -->

---
layout: statement
---

# The key insight behind designing a programming language with undefined behavior is that the compiler is only <span color="orange">obligated</span> to consider cases where the behavior is <span color="green">defined</span>.

---

# Undefined Behavior in C

Consider the following function. The behavior is defined for some inputs and undefined for others.

```c
int32_t unsafe_div_int32_t (int32_t a, int32_t b) {
  return a / b;
}
```

<v-click>

## Why is this function unsafe?

</v-click>

<v-click>
This function has a precondition; it <strong>should only be called</strong> with arguments that satisfy this predicate:

```c
(b != 0) && (!((a == INT32_MIN) && (b == -1)))
```
</v-click>

<div v-click>
The compiler performs a case analysis:
</div>

<v-clicks>

- Case 1: `(b != 0) && (!((a == INT32_MIN) && (b == -1)))` Behavior of `/` operator is defined, so Compiler is obligated to emit code computing `a / b`
- Case 2: `(b == 0) || ((a == INT32_MIN) && (b == -1))` Behavior of `/` operator is undefined, so Compiler has no particular obligations

</v-clicks>

<!-- Now the compiler writers ask themselves the question: What is the most efficient implementation of these two cases? Since Case 2 incurs no obligations, the simplest thing is to simply not consider it. The compiler can emit code only for Case 1.

A Java compiler, in contrast, has obligations in Case 2 and must deal with it (though in this particular case, it is likely that there won‚Äôt be runtime overhead since processors can usually provide trapping behavior for integer divide by zero). -->

---

# More examples of Undefined Behavior in C

```c
int stupid (int a) {
  return (a+1) > a;
}
```

<v-click>

The precondition for avoiding undefined behavior is:

```c
(a != INT_MAX)
```
</v-click>

<v-click>

Here the case analysis done by an optimizing C or C++ compiler is:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- Case 1: `a != INT_MAX`. Behavior of `+` is defined: Computer is obligated to return `1`
- Case 2: `a == INT_MAX`. Behavior of `+` is undefined: Compiler has no particular obligations

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

‚ö†Ô∏èAgain, Case 2 is degenerate and disappears from the compiler‚Äôs reasoning. Case 1 is all that matters. Thus, a good x86-64 compiler will emit:

```asm
stupid:
  movl $1, %eax
  ret
```
</v-click>

---

# A Fun Case Analysis
```c{all|4|6|all}
static void __devexit agnx_pci_remove (struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
  struct ieee80211_hw *dev = pci_get_drvdata(pdev);
  struct agnx_priv *priv = dev->priv; 

  if (!dev) return;
  ... do stuff using dev ...
}
```
The idiom here is to get a pointer to a device struct, test it for null, and then use it. 

<div v-click="1">
<span class="error-text">‚ò†Ô∏èBut there‚Äôs a problem!</span> In this function, the pointer is dereferenced before the null check.
</div>

<v-clicks at="2">

* Case 1: `dev == NULL`
‚Äúdev->priv‚Äù has undefined behavior: Compiler has no particular obligations
* Case 2: `dev != NULL`
Null pointer check won‚Äôt fail: Null pointer check is dead code and may be deleted

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

As we can now easily see, neither case necessitates a null pointer check. *The check is removed*, potentially creating an exploitable security vulnerability.

# What is Call Stack?

<v-clicks>

- A stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.
- Each time a function is called, a new block is created on the top of the stack.
- When the function exits, the block is removed from the stack.
- The call stack is typically used for storing local variables, function parameters, and return addresses.
- The call stack is a limited resource, and if it grows too large it can lead to a stack overflow.
  - Typically around 8 MB on a 64-bit systems.
- The call stack is managed by the operating system and the programming language runtime.

</v-clicks>

<img src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/call-stack.png" alt="stack">

# What is Call Stack?

<v-clicks>

- Arguments to the called functions are pushed reversely. 
- Then return address to caller is pushed
- The callers stack anchor point (in EBP register) is pushed
- Then local variables of the callee are pushed

</v-clicks>

# Boxes live in the Heap

Copying data can take up a lot of memory:

```rust{all|1|2}
let a = [0; 1_000_000];
let b = a;
```

<div class="image-row">
  <img v-click="['1', '2']" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/2-1.png" alt="Image 1">
  <img v-click="2" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/2-2.png" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<v-click>

‚ö†Ô∏èCopying `a` into `b` causes the main frame to contain 2 million elements.

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- To transfer access to data without copying it, Rust uses pointers.
  - A pointer is a value that describes a location in memory. 
- The value that a pointer points-to is called its pointee.
- One common way to make a pointer is to allocate memory in the heap.
- The heap is a separate region of memory where data can live indefinitely.
- ü¶ÄRust provides a construct called `Box` for putting data on the heap.

</v-clicks>

<style>

.image-row {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: end;
  gap: 50px; /* Space between images */
}

.image-row img {
  width: 200px; /* Adjust the size of images */
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 10px; /* Optional: Rounded corners */
}

</style>

---

# Boxes live in the Heap

```rust{all|1|2}
let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);
let b = a;

```

<div class="image-row">
  <img style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" v-click="['1', '2']" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/3-1.png" alt="Image 1">
  <img style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" v-click="2" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/3-2.png" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<v-clicks>

- There is only ever a single array at a time.
- The statement let `b = a` copies the pointer from `a` into `b`, but the pointed-to data is not copied.
- `a` is now grayed out because it has been moved. Will be discussed later.

# Rust Does Not Permit Manual Memory Management
Memory management is the process of allocating memory and deallocating memory. 

<v-clicks depth="2">

* Stack frames are automatically managed by Rust.
  * When a function is called, Rust allocates a stack frame for the called function.
  * When the call ends, Rust deallocates the stack frame.

* Memory deallocation on heap is different
  * C/C++ use manual memory management, Can easily leads to bugs
  * Java/C# use garbage collection, Runtime routines to cleanup. Poor performance
  * Rust uses a different approach

</v-clicks>

# Rust Does Not Permit Manual Memory Management
Imagine that Rust had a free() function that frees a heap allocation

```rust{all|1|2|3}
let b = Box::new([0; 100]);
free(b);
assert!(b[0] == 0);
```

# A Box‚Äôs Owner Manages Deallocation
Box deallocation principle (almost correct): If a variable is bound to a box, when Rust deallocates the variable‚Äôs frame, then Rust deallocates the box‚Äôs heap memory.

```rust{all|2|3|6-8|4}
fn main() {
    let a_num = 4;
    make_and_drop();
}

fn make_and_drop() {
    let a_box = Box::new(5);
}
```
<div class="image-row">
  <img v-click="['1', '3']" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/5-1.png" alt="Image 1">

  <img v-click="4" src="/img/4-understanding-ownership/4-1-what-is-ownership/5-3.png" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<v-click>

The box‚Äôs heap memory has been successfully managed. But what if we abused this system? ü§î

</v-click>

<style>

.image-row {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: end;
  gap: 50px; /* Space between images */
}

.image-row img {
  width: 100px; /* Adjust the size of images */
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 10px; /* Optional: Rounded corners */
}

</style>

---

```rust
let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);
let b = a;
```

<v-clicks>

- The boxed array has now been bound to both `a` and `b`. 
- By our ‚Äúalmost correct‚Äù principle, Rust would try to free the box‚Äôs heap memory twice on behalf of both variables. 

</v-clicks>

<br>

<v-click>

### That‚Äôs undefined behavior too!‚ò†Ô∏è

</v-click>

<v-click>
To avoid this situation, we finally arrive at ownership.
</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- When a is bound to `Box::new([0; 1_000_000])`, we say that `a` owns the box. 
- The statement let `b = a` moves ownership of the box from `a` to `b`

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## ü¶ÄBox deallocation principle (fully correct): If a variable owns a box, when Rust deallocates the variable‚Äôs frame, then Rust deallocates the box‚Äôs heap memory.

# Collections Use Boxes

<v-clicks>

- Boxes are used by Rust data structures like `Vec`, `String`, and `HashMap`
- These data structures are called collections.
- To hold a variable number of elements.

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

```rust
fn main() {
    let first = String::from("Ferris");
    let full = add_suffix(first);
    println!("{full}");
}

fn add_suffix(mut name: String) -> String {
    name.push_str(" Jr.");
    name
}
```
</v-click>
<!-- TODO: Add stack -->

---

# Variables Cannot Be Used After Being Moved

```rust{all|3|4|all}
fn main() {
    let first = String::from("Ferris");
    let full = add_suffix(first);
    println!("{full}, originally {first}"); // first is now used here
}

fn add_suffix(mut name: String) -> String {
    name.push_str(" Jr.");
    name
}
```
<v-clicks at="1">

- first points to deallocated memory after calling `add_suffix`
- Reading first in `println!` would therefore be a violation of memory safety (undefined behavior)
- It‚Äôs not a problem that `first` points to deallocated memory. It‚Äôs a problem that we tried to use `first` after it became invalid.
- This is not an issue for data types that implements `Copy` trait like `i32`

</v-clicks>

# ü¶ÄMoved heap data principle: if `a` variable `x` moves ownership of heap data to another variable `y`, then `x` cannot be used after the move.

<v-click>
Moving ownership of heap data avoids undefined behavior from reading deallocated memory.
</v-click>

## Cloning Avoids Moves
One way to avoid moving data is to clone it using the `.clone()` method.

```rust{all|3}
fn main() {
    let first = String::from("Ferris");
    let first_clone = first.clone();
    let full = add_suffix(first_clone);
    println!("{full}, originally {first}");
}

fn add_suffix(mut name: String) -> String {
    name.push_str(" Jr.");
    name
}
```
